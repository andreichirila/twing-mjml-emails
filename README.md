# Development
run `npm run serve-dev` to serve live-edit client on port 5200 and emails api on port 5201.
Now you can edit the email templates in the `./apps/email-templating-api/src/assets/templates/` directory and see immediate impact in your client.

# Production
run `npm run build` to trigger the production build for the API. The client isn't meant to be built for production, it is only a tool for local development.
